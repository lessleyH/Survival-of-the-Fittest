<h1 align="center">Survival of the Fittest</h1>

Final project for multi-system robotics on foraging with ant optimization. 

## Requirments 
- ROS -- tested on Melodic, but other versions may work.
- colcon -- used for building the application.

## Build
Once cloned in a ROS workspace, e.g., ros_workspace/src/, run the following commands to build it:
 `cd rosworkspace`

 ## Run
source ros_workspace/install/
roslaunch
